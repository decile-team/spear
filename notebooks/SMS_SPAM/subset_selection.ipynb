Subset selection is selecting a small subset of unlabeled data(or the data labeled by LFs, in case of supervised subset selection) so that it can be labeled and use that small labeled data(the L dataset) for effective training of <b>JL algorithm</b>(Cage algorithm doesn't need labeled data). Finding the best subset makes best use of the labeling efforts. Note that for this notebook demo, we need data generated from the first half(labeling part) of sms_jl.ipynb.</p>"
