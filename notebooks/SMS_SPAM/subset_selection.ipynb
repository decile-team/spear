    "# ***Subset selection:***\n",
    "This notebook aims at demonstrating the use cases for the functions in spear library for subset selection. Subset selection is selecting a small subset of unlabeled data(or the data labeled by LFs, in case of supervised subset selection) so that it can be labeled and use that small labeled data(the L dataset) for effective training of <b>JL algorithm</b>. Finding the best subset makes best use of the labeling efforts."
