## Semi-Supervised Data Programming for Data Efficient Machine Learning
SPEAR is a library for data programming with semi-supervision. The package implements several recent data programming approaches including facility to programmatically label and build training data.

### Pipeline
* Design Labeling functions(LFs)
* generate pickle file containing labels by passing raw data to LFs
* Use one of the Label Aggregators(LA) to get final labels

### SPEAR provides functionality such as 
* development of LFs/rules/heuristics for quick labeling
* compare against several data programming approaches
* compare against semi-supervised data programming approaches
* use subset selection to make best use of the annotation efforts
* facility to store and save data in [pickle file](https://spear-decile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#spear.utils.data_editor.get_data)

#### Labelling Functions (LFs)
* discrete LFs - Users can define LFs that return discrete labels
* continuous LFs - return continuous scores/confidence to the labels assigned

#### Approaches Implemented
You can read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09887.pdf) to know about below approaches
* Only-L 
* Learning to Reweight
* Posterior Regularization
* Imply Loss
* CAGE
* Joint Learning

Direct download of the zip file can be done via wget using `gdown` library . 
```bash
pip install gdown
gdown 1CJZ73nNa7Ho0BOSDgGx9CRvXoepVSpet
```

## Installation
* Install Submodlib library
`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ submodlib`
In case of installation issues with the submodlib, please consult [Submodlib Github](https://github.com/decile-team/submodlib).
#### Method 1
To install latest version of SPEAR package using PyPI:
 ```python 
 pip install decile-spear
 ```
#### Method 2    
SPEAR requires Python 3.6 or later. First install [submodlib](https://github.com/decile-team/submodlib#setup). Then install SPEAR:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decile-team/spear.git
cd spear
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

### Acknowledgment
SPEAR takes inspiration, builds upon, and uses pieces of code from several open source codebases. These include [Snorkel](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel), [Snuba](https://github.com/HazyResearch/reef)  & [Imply Loss](https://github.com/awasthiabhijeet/Learning-From-Rules). Also, SPEAR uses [SUBMODLIB](https://github.com/decile-team/submodlib) for subset selection, which is provided by [DECILE](https://decile.org/) too.
